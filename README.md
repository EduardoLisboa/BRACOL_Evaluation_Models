# BRACOL Evaluation Models
Data analysis over the BRACOL dataset

The zipped files inside each folder is to be within the upload size of GitHub.

Each of the folders has the images already organized for the models to run, just unzip the files inside the same folder as the Python file.

The spreadsheet with the results can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JCaUYlA3A133hBeFI3bEImHne6mpRggRBqoD6X06d3Q/edit?usp=sharing).

### Model 1 - Haralick Features
This model used Haralick Features to train and make predictions.

### Model 2 - Local Binary Patterns (LBP)
This model used LBP to train and make predictions.

### Model 3 - VGG16
The VGG16 model was retrained with the BRACOL dataset and used to make predictions.

### Model 4 - My Model
The model I designed trained with the BRACOL dataset and used to make predictions.
